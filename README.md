### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Tarun and I'm currently a Masters student at UoA. I also graduated from AUT in 2022 where I completed part-time work on a R&D project. I'm on the hunt for a part-time or full-time backend or fullstack role.

Currently working on the AUIS repo, where I'll be implementing the Stripe payment system.
